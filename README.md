# Data Preparation
In the data preperation step, the raw sales data from the coffee shop, including transaction records, product information will be collected and orgnized into a structured format suitable for analysis in Excel. This involves cleaning the data to remove any incosistencies, errors, or missing values,standardizing formats, and ensuring data integrity. Additionally, data is aggregated and tranformation as needed to facilitate analysis as calculating total sales, average order value, and average bill per person.

# Data Cleaning and Tranformation
In Power query editor,
Reviewing each column to get a good graps of data and understanding its context within the domain. This helps in recognizing errors, inconsistencies and important information related to coffee shop's operation. Abbrevations such as "Lg,""Rg",and "Sm" were used to represent the size of products in the "product_detail" column.

* Leading and Trailing spaces were eliminated from all columns, enhancing the cleanliness and uniformity of the dataset   

* The "transaction_time" column underwent a refinement process where date values were removed, leaving only the time in HH:MM:SS format
